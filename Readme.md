# Make Tea Mod FORKED
Original by: [urm](https://mods.vintagestory.at/maketea)

## Features:

* Clay form teapots and mugs.
* Fire them in a pit or beehive kiln, with full clay color support.
* Boil water in the teapot, add herbs and brew tea, with new UI, graphics and sound effects!
* Tea recipes for every in-game herb (currently that includes all the flowers).
* Brewing temperature matters! Pay attention to the UI colors and keep notes of the proper temperature ranges.
* Drink tea while it is still fresh, it won't be long before it's no better than muddy water.
* Make sure to drink from a mug to fully appreaciate some teas!
